## 📊 **Current State: Waystone's AI Journey**

### **Maturity Level**: Early Adoption (Regulatory-Driven)

**✅ What They Have:**
- Established **AI Working Group** with governance structure
- Architecture forums for AI initiative validation
- Legal and regulatory compliance processes
- "Shadow AI" added to IT risk register
- Plans for automation and integration for AI visibility

**🔍 Current AI Usage:**
- Limited to vendor solutions (e.g., Microsoft Copilot)
- Cautious, compliance-first rollout approach
- Focus on regulatory adherence (EU AI Act, UAE DIFC 10)

**⚠️ Key Challenges:**
- **Shadow AI Risk**: Recognized as critical, needs tracking/visibility
- **Fragmented Systems**: Multiple asset management systems (Autotask, Meraki)
- **Integration Complexity**: Identity management, network data, diverse platforms
- **Budget Constraints**: Evaluating Vanta for ISO27001; concerned about duplicate costs
- **Procurement Concerns**: Scenario-based pricing model could escalate costs rapidly

---

## 🎯 **What Went Well**

### **1. High Engagement & Trust**
- Aoman's feedback: "looks great," "very interesting," "unique solution"
- Actively sought advice on navigating technology landscape
- Provided direct, honest feedback on pricing model
- Transparent about internal processes and challenges

### **2. Strong Governance Foundation**
- Dedicated AI Working Group demonstrates commitment
- Clear regulatory drivers (EU AI Act, UAE DIFC 10)
- Proactive approach to shadow AI risk
- Well-structured validation processes

### **3. Clear Use Case Alignment**
- Shadow AI tracking is a recognized priority
- Need for compliance readiness across multiple frameworks
- Desire for actionable governance tools
- Integration requirements align with Kovrr's capabilities

---

## ⚠️ **Concerns & Objections**

### **1. Pricing Model** (🔴 Critical)
**Issue**: "Per block of scenarios" pricing could rapidly escalate costs
- **Impact**: Procurement challenges, budget unpredictability
- **Context**: Limited current AI usage means scenario count may grow significantly
- **Risk**: Could become deal-breaker if not addressed

### **2. Vanta Overlap** (🟡 Important)
**Issue**: Evaluating Vanta for ISO27001 and regulatory compliance
- **Impact**: Perceived redundancy with Kovrr's solution
- **Context**: Already committed to Vanta evaluation; need clear differentiation
- **Risk**: Kovrr must demonstrate unique value beyond Vanta's capabilities

### **3. ROI Justification** (🟡 Important)
**Issue**: Need to demonstrate strong, scalable return on investment
- **Impact**: Difficulty justifying cost given early AI adoption stage
- **Context**: Limited AI usage today, uncertain growth trajectory
- **Risk**: Value proposition must be compelling for future-state, not just current state

### **4. Integration Complexity** (🟢 Manageable)
**Issue**: Fragmented systems require multiple integrations
- **Impact**: Implementation effort and timeline concerns
- **Context**: Identity management, network data, Autotask, Meraki, etc.
- **Risk**: Kovrr must show clear integration path and effort estimates

## 📋 **Revised Strategy: Passive Approach**

### **Key Insight from Internal Discussion (Dec 3, 2025)**

**Decision**: **Wait and observe** rather than proactive engagement

**Rationale**:
1. **Customer Not Ready for Evaluation**: Waystone needs to complete their internal process first
2. **Internal-First Approach**: Aoman's strategy is to build the process internally with IT, map it together, and only then evaluate external solutions
3. **Vanta Evaluation in Progress**: They need to complete Vanta assessment (Jan/Feb 2026) before considering additional tools
4. **Pricing Sensitivity**: Strong concerns about costs indicate they're not ready for commercial discussions
5. **December Timing**: End-of-year is not productive for deal progression

**Revised Timeline**: **3-4 weeks (late December/early January 2026)**

---

## 📋 **Revised Action Items**

### **Immediate Actions (This Week)**

#### **1. No Immediate Deliverables** ❌
**Decision**: Do NOT prepare pricing proposals, detailed comparisons, or implementation plans at this time

**Why**: 
- Too early in their evaluation process
- Pricing discussion is premature and could create friction
- They need to complete Vanta evaluation first
- Internal process mapping must happen before external solution evaluation

---

#### **2. Maintain Relationship (Mashav)**
**Action**: Send brief, low-pressure follow-up email

**Email Approach**:
- Thank them for the productive discussion
- Acknowledge they're in early stages
- Express interest in staying connected
- **No specific deliverables or deadlines**
- **No pricing discussion**
- Keep door open for future conversation

---

#### **3. Schedule Check-in (Mashav)**
**Timeline**: **Late December 2025 / Early January 2026** (3-4 weeks)

**Purpose**:
- Light touch-base to see progress on:
  - Vanta evaluation status
  - Internal compliance process mapping
  - AI Working Group developments
- Share Kovrr platform updates (if significant progress made)
- Gauge readiness for deeper engagement

**Format**: 15-minute informal call (not a formal presentation)

---

#### **4. Internal Preparation (Kovrr Team)**
**Focus**: Use this time to strengthen our offering

**Platform Development Priorities**:
- Mature the AI risk assessment module
- Enhance compliance planning features
- Improve asset management workflow
- Develop Vanta integration/complementary positioning

**By Late January 2026, Have Ready**:
- More mature platform demo
- Clearer Vanta differentiation story
- Case studies from financial services (if available)
- Flexible pricing models (but don't lead with them)

---

## 🎯 **Strategic Recommendations**

### **1. Position as Vanta Complement, Not Competitor**
- "Vanta handles your general IT compliance (ISO27001, SOC2)"
- "Kovrr specializes in AI-specific governance (EU AI Act, DIFC 10)"
- "Together, you have comprehensive coverage without gaps"

### **2. Lead with Shadow AI Value**
- This is Waystone's #1 pain point
- Demonstrate quick win (8-week implementation)
- Show tangible risk reduction metrics
- Position as "insurance" against regulatory penalties

### **3. Address Pricing Head-On**
- Acknowledge concern directly
- Present multiple options (not just one model)
- Show cost comparison vs. building in-house
- Emphasize predictability and scalability

### **4. Leverage Regulatory Drivers**
- EU AI Act compliance deadlines
- UAE DIFC 10 requirements
- Financial services regulatory scrutiny
- Board-level reporting needs

### **5. Provide Social Proof**
- Case studies from financial services (if available)
- Regulatory compliance success stories
- Shadow AI detection metrics from other clients
- Integration success examples
