FAQS
 
(H3)
 
[CTA
 
??]
 
 
1.
 
What
 
is
 
AI
 
governance?
 
a.
 
AI
 
governance
 
is
 
the
 
framework
 
of
 
policies,
 
safeguards,
 
and
 
accountability
 
practices
 
that
 
ensure
 
AI,
 
including
 
GenAI,
 
is
 
deployed
 
responsibly
 
and
 
in
 
compliance
 
with
 
regulations.
 
Kovrr’s
 
AI
 
governance
 
software
 
supports
 
this
 
process
 
through
 
assessments
 
that
 
benchmark
 
governance
 
maturity
 
and
 
through
 
risk
 
quantification
 
that
 
translates
 
results
 
into
 
financial
 
and
 
operational
 
terms,
 
helping
 
organizations
 
close
 
oversight
 
gaps,
 
demonstrate
 
accountability,
 
and
 
align
 
AI
 
adoption
 
with
 
enterprise
 
goals.
 
 
2.
 
Why
 
is
 
AI
 
governance
 
software
 
becoming
 
essential
 
for
 
enterprises?
 
a.
 
AI
 
adoption
 
is
 
accelerating
 
across
 
every
 
business
 
function,
 
often
 
faster
 
than
 
oversight
 
can
 
keep
 
up.
 
Without
 
structured
 
governance,
 
organizations
 
face
 
greater
 
exposure
 
to
 
compliance
 
failures,
 
bias,
 
and
 
operational
 
disruption.
 
AI
 
governance
 
software
 
provides
 
the
 
foundation
 
to
 
manage
 
these
 
risks
 
responsibly,
 
defining
 
accountability,
 
maintaining
 
transparency,
 
and
 
ensuring
 
AI
 
decisions
 
align
 
with
 
business
 
and
 
regulatory
 
objectives.
 
 
3.
 
How
 
does
 
AI
 
governance
 
differ
 
from
 
traditional
 
risk
 
management?
 
a.
 
Traditional
 
risk
 
management
 
focuses
 
on
 
static,
 
well-defined
 
processes,
 
while
 
AI
 
governance
 
addresses
 
a
 
dynamic
 
ecosystem
 
where
 
models
 
evolve,
 
data
 
shifts,
 
and
 
accountability
 
can
 
blur.
 
It
 
emphasizes
 
continuous
 
monitoring,
 
transparency,
 
and
 
ethical
 
alignment
 
alongside
 
security
 
and
 
compliance,
 
turning
 
complex
 
oversight
 
into
 
measurable,
 
defensible
 
management
 
practices.
 
 
4.
 
How
 
can
 
organizations
 
measure
 
the
 
maturity
 
of
 
their
 
AI
 
governance
 
programs?
 
a.
 
Maturity
 
is
 
measured
 
by
 
how
 
consistently
 
and
 
transparently
 
AI
 
safeguards
 
are
 
applied
 
across
 
the
 
enterprise.
