What
 
is
 
AI
 
Third-Party
 
Risk
 
Management?
 
a.
 
Kovrr’s
 
AI
 
Third-Party
 
Risk
 
Management
 
module
 
helps
 
organizations
 
identify,
 
evaluate,
 
and
 
continuously
 
monitor
 
AI-related
 
risks
 
introduced
 
through
 
vendors,
 
suppliers,
 
and
 
partners.
 
It
 
provides
 
a
 
centralized
 
view
 
of
 
how
 
third
 
parties
 
use
 
AI,
 
complete
 
with
 
risk
 
scores,
 
compliance
 
benchmarking,
 
and
 
contract
 
tracking.
 
The
 
result
 
is
 
a
 
defensible,
 
data-driven
 
oversight
 
process
 
that
 
strengthens
 
accountability
 
and
 
trust
 
across
 
the
 
entire
 
supply
 
chain.

Why
 
is
 
managing
 
third-party
 
AI
 
use
 
essential
 
for
 
governance?
 
a.
 
Vendors
 
often
 
embed
 
AI
 
into
 
their
 
systems
 
without
 
formal
 
disclosure,
 
creating
 
unseen
 
exposure
 
points
 
that
 
can
 
undermine
 
compliance
 
and
 
resilience.
 
Continuous
 
monitoring
 
ensures
 
every
 
external
 
AI
 
dependency
 
is
 
visible,
 
evaluated,
 
and
 
aligned
 
with
 
organizational
 
safeguards.
 
This
 
visibility
 
reduces
 
the
 
likelihood
 
of
 
unexpected
 
regulatory,
 
operational,
 
or
 
reputational
 
risk.

What
 
types
 
of
 
vendors
 
or
 
partners
 
can
 
be
 
evaluated
 
with
 
this
 
module?
 
a.
 
The
 
module
 
supports
 
a
 
wide
 
range
 
of
 
third-party
 
relationships,
 
from
 
SaaS
 
and
 
cloud
 
providers
 
to
 
service
 
partners,
 
data
 
processors,
 
and
 
outsourced
 
development
 
teams.
 
Any
 
vendor
 
deploying
 
or
 
embedding
 
AI
 
that
 
interacts
 
with
 
your
 
systems,
 
data,
 
or
 
customers
 
can
 
be
 
monitored.
 
This
 
flexibility
 
ensures
 
comprehensive
 
coverage
 
of
 
external
 
AI
 
exposure,
 
including
 
sub-vendors
 
and
 
indirect
 
suppliers.

How
 
often
 
should
 
organizations
 
review
 
third-party
 
AI
 
governance
 
maturity?
 
a.
 
AI-related
 
vendor
 
risk
 
should
 
be
 
reviewed
 
on
 
an
 
ongoing
 
basis
 
rather
 
than
 
as
 
a
 
one-time
 
assessment.
 
Kovrr’s
 
third-party
 
AI
 
risk
 
governance
 
module
 
supports
 
continuous
 
monitoring,
 
automatically
 
updating
 
when
 
vendor
 
AI
 
usage,
 
safeguards,
 
or
 
regulatory
 
status
 
change.
 
This
 
consistent
 
oversight
 
helps
 
organizations
 
maintain
 
compliance
 
readiness
 
and
 
ensures
 
that
 
third-party
 
governance
 
standards
 
evolve
 
in
 
step
 
with
 
their
 
own
 
internal
 
AI
 
management
