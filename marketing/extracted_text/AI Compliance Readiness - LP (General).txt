(H1)
 
 
 
As
 
GenAI
 
adoption
 
accelerates,
 
organizations
 
face
 
increasing
 
regulatory
 
scrutiny
 
and
 
evolving
 
compliance
 
expectations.
 
Kovrr’s
 
AI
 
Compliance
 
Readiness
 
module
 
helps
 
security,
 
risk,
 
and
 
compliance
 
teams
 
evaluate
 
how
 
well
 
current
 
safeguards
 
align
 
with
 
frameworks
 
such
 
as
 
NIST
 
AI
 
RMF,
 
ISO
 
42001,
 
and
 
the
 
EU
 
AI
 
Act.
 
Through
 
guided
 
questionnaires
 
and
 
evidence
 
workflows,
 
teams
 
can
 
identify
 
control
 
gaps,
 
document
 
readiness,
 
and
 
plan
 
improvements
 
that
 
strengthen
 
responsible
 
AI
 
governance.

AI
 
systems
 
are
 
being

While
 
these

equipped
 
to
 
address.

Kovrr’s
 
AI
 
Compliance
 
Readiness
 
assessment
 
does
 
more
 
than
 
measure
 
governance
 
maturity.
 
It
 
starts
 
the
 
conversation
 
about
 
how
 
AI
 
is
 
developed,
 
deployed,
 
and
 
governed
 
across
 
the
 
business.
 
The
 
process
 
promotes
 
collaboration
 
between
 
teams
 
and
 
reinforces
 
shared
 
accountability,
 
while
 
providing
 
a

cross-departmental

and
 
long-term
 
auditability.

Completing

assessment
 
is
 
the

impact
 
of
 
noncompliance
 
or
 
AI-related
 
incidents
 
in
 
measurable
 
business
 
terms.
 
Together,
 
they
 
create
 
a
 
continuous

that
 
links

assurance
 
to
 
data-driven
