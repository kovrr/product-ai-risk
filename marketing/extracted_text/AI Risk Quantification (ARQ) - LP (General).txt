(H1)
 
 
Kovrr’s
 
AI
 
Risk
 
Quantification
 
module
 
helps
 
organizations
 
measure
 
and
 
manage
 
AI
 
risk
 
with
 
precision
 
and
 
scale.
 
Its
 
simulation-based
 
modeling
 
engine
 
calculates
 
the
 
likelihood
 
and
 
potential
 
losses
 
of
 
AI-related
 
incidents
 
using
 
industry
 
data,
 
mapped
 
controls,
 
and
 
frequency-severity
 
distributions.
 
The
 
results
 
translate
 
complex
 
exposure
 
into
 
clear
 
financial
 
and
 
operational
 
terms,
 
enabling
 
leaders
 
to
 
prioritize
 
protections,
 
report
 
risk
 
transparently,
 
and
 
strengthen
 
long-term
 
resilience.

Kovrr’s

process
 
starts
 
by
 
capturing
 
how
 
GenAI
 
and
 
other
 
AI
 
systems
 
are
 
deployed
 
across
 
your
 
business.
 
It
 
incorporates
 
real-world

and

The

that

change.
 
These
