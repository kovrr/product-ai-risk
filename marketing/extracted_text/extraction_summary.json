Please proceed to the next section if you are seeking to you risk accepting access to AI Systems or Products.  AI Risk Assessment Form This form should be used to determine the level of risk in using a specific AI System or product. The assessment will determine the oversight and controls required unless the AI System must be treated as High Risk because of regulatory requirements. See the AI policy [LINK] for regulatory definitions. Please note - This assessment does not replace the Strategic Sourcing, Technology or Data assessments that may be required.

Definitions: Criticality \u2013 Refers to the impact that an event, process, or system failure due to this AI system, would have on the organisation's ability to achieve its objectives.  Audience \u2013 Refers to the reach the application output and influence it is likely to have. Data Privacy \u2013 Provides guidelines on different risk levels depending on the data type. Ethical Use \u2013 refers to the way that the AI system is used and whether that could create bias or other ethical issues.  Data Classification \u2013 what type of data is consumed by the application aligned to FSI Data Classification Standard.  Complexity and interpretability \u2013 refers to how easy or difficult it is to understand how the AI works, is trained and the data used to train. Cybersecurity (AI Vendor Assessment) - The outcome of the Cybersecurity assessment available here [LINK] Potential Impact and probability of failure \u2013 financial; based on the Risk Management Framework (RMF) impact matrix If the application does not work as intended, what is the maximum financial impact the organisation might face in terms of repairs, upgrades, reporting, compensation, etc.  Potential Impact and probability of failure \u2013 non-financial - for all other measures captured within the RMF impact matrix what would be the maximum perceived impact from the perspective of, Clients, Regulators, reputational, etc.  Sustainability impact \u2013 refers to the impact of the AI system in terms of energy usage, consumption, carbon, and other sustainability factors.  Availability/Resilience \u2013 Consider factors such as operational soundness how likely is it to break down and how often relative with the complexity and the availability of skilled individuals, vendors etc. to support maintenance and repair.  Action \u2013 AI or Human execution - Human executed / Human in the Loop = An employee reviews the AI generated outcome and underlying data to validate the AI\u2019s output, applying the contextual judgement/review that may be missed by the AI system. The employee completes any decision making and communication of the outcome.  AI execution = The process completes without any human/employee intervention or effort. These outcomes can be reviewed retrospectively, which could include sampling or reviewed at the model level, usually both  "
