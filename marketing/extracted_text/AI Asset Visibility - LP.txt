Why
 
AI
 
Asset
 
Visibility
 
Matters
 
(H2)
 
 
Kovrr's
 
AI
 
Asset
 
Visibility
 
module
 
establishes
 
a
 
single
 
source
 
of
 
truth
 
for
 
how
 
AI
 
operates
 
across
 
the
 
enterprise.
 
It
 
provides
 
security
 
and
 
GRC
 
professionals
 
with
 
continuous
 
awareness
 
of
 
where
 
AI
 
exists,
 
who
 
uses
 
it,
 
and
 
what
 
data
 
it
 
touches.
 
With
 
this
 
foundation,
 
leaders
 
can
 
more
 
easily
 
maintain
 
accountability,
 
demonstrate
 
compliance,
 
and
 
make
 
governance
 
decisions
 
grounded
 
in
 
measurable,
 
verifiable
 
evidence
 
that
 
strengthens
 
trust
 
and

What
 
is
 
AI
 
asset
 
visibility?
 
a.
 
Kovrr’s
 
AI
 
Asset
 
Visibility
 
module
 
automatically
 
discovers
 
and
 
maps
 
every
 
AI
 
tool
 
across
 
the
 
enterprise,
 
sanctioned
 
or
 
shadow,
 
within
 
48
 
hours.
 
It
 
builds
 
the
 
first
 
unified
 
inventory
 
of
 
where
 
AI
 
operates,
 
who
 
uses
 
it,
 
and
 
what
 
data
 
it
 
interacts
 
with.
 
This
 
visibility
 
gives
 
leaders
 
the
 
evidence
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
answer
 
board
 
and
 
regulatory
 
questions,
 
demonstrate
 
oversight,
 
and
 
lay
 
the
 
groundwork
 
for
 
measurable,
 
defensible
 
AI
 
governance.
 
 
2.
 
How
 
does
 
Kovrr
 
discover
 
AI
 
tools
 
in
 
use
 
across
 
the
 
organization?
 
a.
 
Kovrr
 
combines
 
lightweight
 
integrations
 
with
 
identity
 
systems,
 
system
 
scans,
 
team
 
surveys,
 
and
 
CSV
 
imports
 
to
 
identify
 
all
 
AI
 
tools,
 
including
 
sanctioned,
 
shadow,
 
and
 
embedded.
 
This
 
approach
 
captures
 
usage
 
data
 
across
 
departments
 
and
 
vendors
 
without
 
deploying
 
agents
 
or
 
invasive
 
monitoring.
 
Within
 
48
 
hours,
 
organizations
 
receive
 
a
 
verified
 
AI
 
inventory
 
that
 
supports
 
governance
 
readiness,
 
compliance
 
reporting,
 
and
 
informed
 
risk
 
analysis,
 
replacing
 
weeks
 
of
 
manual
 
data
 
collection.
 
 
3.
 
Can
 
the
 
AI
 
Asset
 
Visibility
 
module
 
replace
 
manual
 
AI
 
tracking
 
workflows?
 
a.
 
Yes.
 
Most
 
organizations
 
still
 
rely
 
on
 
scattered
 
spreadsheets,
 
shared
 
folders,
 
and
 
email
 
approvals
 
to
 
track
 
AI
 
tools
 
and
 
exemptions.
 
Kovrr
 
automates
 
those
 
processes
 
by
 
continuously
 
discovering
 
new
 
AI
 
usage,
 
updating
 
records
 
in
 
real
 
time,
 
and
 
maintaining
 
change-tracked
 
lists
 
of
 
approved
 
and
 
unapproved
 
tools.
 
The
 
result
 
is
 
a
 
living,
 
auditable
 
inventory
 
that
 
reduces
 
administrative
 
overhead
 
and
 
ensures
 
governance
 
documentation
 
always
 
reflects
 
how
 
AI
 
is
 
actually
 
used.
 
 
b.
 
Does
 
Kovrr’s
 
AI
 
Asset
 
Visibility
 
connect
 
to
 
other
 
AI
 
modules?
 
c.
 
Yes.
 
In
 
fact,
 
the
 
AI
 
Asset
 
Visibility
 
module
 
serves
 
as
 
the
 
foundation
 
for
 
Kovrr’s
 
broader
 
AI
 
Governance
 
suite.
 
Once
 
assets
 
are
 
discovered
 
and
 
classified,
 
their
 
details
 
flow
 
directly
 
into
 
the
 
other
 
modules,
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
AI
 
Maturity
 
Gap
 
Analysis
 
and
 
AI
 
Third-Party
 
Management
 
modules,
 
where
 
financial
 
exposure
 
and
 
safeguard
 
maturity
 
are
 
evaluated.
 
This
 
integration
 
creates
 
a
 
continuous
 
feedback
 
loop
 
to
 
provide
 
leadership
 
with
 
complete
 
visibility
 
and
 
control
 
across
 
the
 
AI
 
lifecycle.
